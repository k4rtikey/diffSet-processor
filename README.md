# diffSet-processor
Code I wrote during Summer '19 to help do calculations in research with Dr. James Davis on difference sets and incidence matrices. 
Implements functions to generate difference sets of the form Za x Zb x Zc..., get their incidence matrix, row reduce it etc. 
Not very structured as repositories go as I was managing version control by making actual copies of the code and editing them B). Don't make that face I know about git now.
